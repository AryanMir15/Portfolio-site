  details: `
This project replicates the core functionality of an e-commerce platform using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Pages and Features:
- **Products Page**: Displays a list of sample products in a responsive grid layout.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can filter products by name using a client-side search bar.
- **Cart Page**: Divided into two sections â€” Order Summary and Payment Summary. Items can be added or removed dynamically, and total prices update accordingly.
- **Track Orders Page**: Shows a list of placed orders. Each order includes a button to view its delivery progress.
- **Progress Tracker**: Simulates order delivery using animated progress bars and estimated times.

All data is managed with localStorage for persistence, and the site is fully responsive across screen sizes.
