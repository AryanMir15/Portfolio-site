A responsive front-end application built in React that interacts with the CocktailDB API.

### Main Features:
- **Home Page**: Displays a list of all cocktails retrieved from the API.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can filter the list of drinks by entering keywords in real time.
- **Single Cocktail View**: Clicking a drink navigates to a details page showing its ingredients, instructions, and category.
- **Routing**: Implemented using React Router, with clean URL handling and fallback routes.
- **Styling**: Built with Tailwind CSS for consistent and responsive design.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of API integration, component-based architecture, and modern React practices.
