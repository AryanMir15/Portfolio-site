          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            I'm a fullstack developer focused on building clean, functional web
            applications with solid architecture and polished interfaces. From
            pixel-perfect UIs to backend logic that actually scales, I handle
            the full pipeline.

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            I donâ€™t rush projects or copy-paste my way through tutorials. Every
            feature I ship is something Iâ€™ve thought through, tested, and
            refined. When I work, I care about detail, structure, and how it all
            feels to use.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            Whether it's a portfolio site, a custom dashboard, or a SaaS tool, I
            aim to make it not just work, but work well. And if something
            doesn't feel right, I donâ€™t settle â€” I iterate until it does.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            Iâ€™m not here to overcomplicate things or chase trends. I like
            shipping clean code, solving real problems, and building products
            that feel like they were made with intention.
          </p>
